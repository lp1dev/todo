# Todo

### Simple command line todolist

I first wrote the Python version 4 years ago, and a few days ago decided to do the same program over using different languages.
Here is the original readme that I'm using as specifications :

> todo
> ====
>
> Todo is a python program to manage his tasks in command line. (For example with conky)
>
> How to use :
>
> ./todo [option]
>
> --Options--
>
> add     NAME  : Add a new task
>
> rm      TASK_ID	: Remove a task
>
> status  TASK_ID	: Change the status of a task
